# serverless-models-plugin

This plugin adds the missing model support to Serverless 0.5.x.

## Overview
The plugin lets you define your models within your project.
Models are important as soon as you play around with the mobile SDK's generated by AWS Gateway.
They define the typed results or inputs of your API definition and are mapped to classes in
the SDK's. One advantage is, that if a model is used in more than one endpoints of your API,
or a model references other models for its sub-objects, the generated SDK uses exactly the
same class definition instance throughout the SDK.

As soon as you reference them within your endpoint definitions and deploy the endpiont, the needed
models are uploaded to API Gateway. If the model already exists, the definition is updated.

## Installation
*NOTE YET AVAILABLE!* Will be `npm install serverless-models-plugin`.

## Usage
### Model definition
Within your Serverless project root create a `s-models.json` or `s-models.yaml` (both formats are
supported). Within this file define your models.

_Example (YAML)_
```
myModelOne:
  type: object
  properties:
    myProp:
      type: string
    myProp2:
      type: number
myModelTwo:
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
```

#### Model references
Models can reference other models. You can do this easily by adding `$ref` properties that
refer to another defined model. The plugin will take care of including and deploying referenced
models properly.

_Example_
```
myModelOne:
  type: object
  properties:
    myProp:
      type: string
    myProp2:
      type: number
myModelTwo:
  type: array
  items:
    $ref: myModelOne
```

### Using models in endpoints
If you want to declare a response (output) or request (input) model for an endpoint, you just have 
to add it to your `s-function.json` accordingly (see requestModels and responseModels properties):

```
{
  "name": "testfct2",
  "runtime": "nodejs",
  "description": "Serverless Lambda function for project: testp1",
  "customName": false,
  "customRole": false,
  "handler": "handler.handler",
  "timeout": 6,
  "memorySize": 1024,
  "authorizer": {},
  "custom": {
    "excludePatterns": []
  },
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "path": "testfct2",
      "method": "GET",
      "type": "AWS",
      "authorizationType": "none",
      "authorizerFunction": false,
      "apiKeyRequired": false,
      "requestParameters": {},
      "requestModels": {
        "application/json": "myModelOne"
      },
      "requestTemplates": {
        "application/json": ""
      },
      "responses": {
        "400": {
          "statusCode": "400"
        },
        "default": {
          "statusCode": "200",
          "responseParameters": {},
          "responseModels": {
            "application/json": "myModelTwo"
          },
          "responseTemplates": {
            "application/json": ""
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "events": [],
  "environment": {
    "SERVERLESS_PROJECT": "${project}",
    "SERVERLESS_STAGE": "${stage}",
    "SERVERLESS_REGION": "${region}"
  },
  "vpc": {
    "securityGroupIds": [],
    "subnetIds": []
  }
}
```

### Helper commands
The plugin also adds some new commands to Serverless: `sls models XXXXXX`

#### list
Lists the defined model names

#### show
Shows specified model definitions as JSON or YAML.
Usage: `sls models show <model names> [--format json|yaml]`
